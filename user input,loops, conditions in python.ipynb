    "# User input in python\n",
    "### In Python, taking input from the user is commonly achieved using the `input()` function, which reads a line from the input, converts it to a string, and returns it. To handle different data types, you typically need to convert this string into the desired type using Python's built-in functions. Here's how you can handle different data types when taking user input:\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Input\n",
    "Strings are the default data type for user input in Python, as `input()` returns a string.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integer Input\n",
    "To get an integer from the user, you need to convert the input string to an integer using `int()`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "print(\"You are\", age, \"years old.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Float Input\n",
    "For decimal or floating-point numbers, convert the input using `float()`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "height = float(input(\"Enter your height in meters: \"))\n",
    "print(\"Your height is\", height, \"meters.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these examples demonstrates how to take user input and convert it into different data types, which is useful for various applications such as data processing, user interaction, and forms within a Python application."

    "# If-Else condition in Python\n",
    "### In Python, `if-else` conditions are used to control the flow of execution based on whether a condition is true or false. Here's a brief explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **If Statement**: An `if` statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if condition:\n",
    "       # code to execute if the condition is true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Else Statement**: An `else` statement follows an `if` statement and contains code that is executed if the `if` condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if condition:\n",
    "       # code to execute if the condition is true\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       # code to execute if the condition is false\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elif Statement**: The `elif` (short for else if) is used when you need to check multiple conditions in a row. It must be placed after an `if` statement and before an `else` statement. The `elif` statement checks another condition if the previous conditions were not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if condition1:\n",
    "       # code to execute if condition1 is true\n",
    "   elif condition2:\n",
    "       # code to execute if condition2 is true\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       # code to execute if both conditions are false\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows you to build complex decision-making into your programs, directing different outcomes based on different inputs or conditions."

    "### Here's a simple example that demonstrates the use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Python. This script will categorize a person's age into different life stages:\n",

    "# Loops in Python\n",
    "### In Python, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true or over a sequence of elements. There are two primary types of loops in Python: **`for` loops** and **`while` loops**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. For Loops\n",
    "`For` loops are used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or any other iterable object. They execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(\"Current fruit:\", fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This loop will print the name of each fruit in the list `fruits`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. While Loops\n",
    "`While` loops execute as long as a given condition remains true. If the condition becomes false, the loop stops executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 1\n",
    "while count <= 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Count is:\", count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "This loop will print numbers from 1 to 5. The loop continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controlling Loop Execution\n",
    "- **`break`**: Terminates the loop entirely and moves to the next statement after the loop.\n",
    "- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with `break` and `continue`:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in range(1, 10):\n",
    "    if num == 7:\n",
    "        break  # stop the loop if the number is 7\n",
    "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue  # skip even numbers\n",
    "    print(\"Number:\", num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This loop prints odd numbers until it reaches 7, where it breaks out of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops in Python are a powerful tool for performing repetitive tasks, allowing programmers to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency."
