   "source": [
    "An **Object-Relational Manager (ORM)** is a tool or software that makes it easier to interact with databases using object-oriented programming languages like Python, Java, or C++. The ORM automates the process of converting data between two incompatible systems: **relational databases** (which store data in tables) and **object-oriented programs** (which use objects and classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing SQL queries to interact with the database, you use the ORM to handle these operations in the form of objects. This makes it easier to work with databases using familiar programming concepts like objects, classes, and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How ORMs Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mapping Between Objects and Database Tables**:\n",
    "   - **Classes** in the code are mapped to **tables** in the database.\n",
    "   - **Objects** (instances of classes) correspond to **rows** in the database tables.\n",
    "   - The **attributes** of the objects map to the **columns** in the database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automatic SQL Generation**:\n",
    "   - The ORM translates the operations you perform on objects into SQL queries behind the scenes. For example:\n",
    "     - If you create an object in your program (like a new `Student`), the ORM will automatically generate the SQL `INSERT` query to add that object to the database.\n",
    "     - Similarly, if you update an object, the ORM will generate an `UPDATE` query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Data Relationships**:\n",
    "   - ORMs can manage **relationships** between different objects (like students and their courses) and ensure that these relationships are properly represented in the database using foreign keys and joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using an ORM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Need to Write SQL**: You don't need to manually write SQL queries for basic operations like inserting, updating, deleting, or retrieving data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Cross-Database Compatibility**: ORMs often support multiple databases, allowing you to switch databases without changing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improved Productivity**: Working with objects and classes in a programming language is generally faster and less error-prone than writing raw SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Easier Maintenance**: Since your code interacts with the ORM rather than the database directly, changes to the database schema (like renaming a column) can often be managed by updating the ORM mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Without ORM:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 20);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With ORM:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_student = Student(name='Alice', age=20)\n",
    "db_session.add(new_student)\n",
    "db_session.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the ORM takes care of converting the object `new_student` into a proper SQL `INSERT` statement and saving it to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, an **Object-Relational Manager (ORM)** is a useful tool for simplifying and automating database interactions in modern programming."
