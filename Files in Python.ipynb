   "source": [
    "Each of these modes provides different capabilities depending on your needs, whether it's just reading data, overwriting it, appending to it, or doing a combination of reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file to read\n",
    "file = open('myfile.txt', 'r')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Creating a New File\n",
    "To create a new file in Python, use the open function with mode `'w'`. If the file does not exist, Python will create it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a new file\n",
    "file = open('newfile.txt', 'w')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Writing to a File\n",
    "You can write text to a file by using the `write()` method. If the file is opened in write mode (`'w'`), any existing content in the file will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('newfile.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write(\"Hello! Welcome to Python file handling.\")\n",
    "file.close()  # It's important to close the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appending to a File\n",
    "If you want to add text to an existing file without removing its content, you use append mode (`'a'`). This mode will write data to the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('newfile.txt', 'a')\n",
    "file.write(\"\\nThis is a new line added to the existing file.\")\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Reading from a File\n",
    "To read the contents of a file, you can use methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `read()` - Reads the whole file at once.\n",
    "- `readline()` - Reads the next line of the file.\n",
    "- `readlines()` - Reads all the lines of the file into a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('myfile.txt', 'r')\n",
    "content = file.read()  # Read the entire content\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Closing a File\n",
    "Always remember to close the file when you're done with it. Closing a file will free up the resources that were tied with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Using `with` Statement for Files\n",
    "The `with` statement makes it easier to handle files as it takes care of opening and closing the file automatically. This is highly recommended because it also handles unexpected errors by closing the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "# File is automatically closed here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Examples:\n",
    "- In the examples where we open a file using `open()`, you provide the name of the file and the mode (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, or `'r+'`). The file handle (like `file` in the examples) is used to perform operations like reading or writing.\n",
    "- After writing or reading, it's crucial to close the file using `file.close()` to ensure that all changes are saved and resources are released.\n",
    "- Using the `with` statement simplifies the process of opening and closing files, making your code cleaner and more readable."

    "### 3. Using `readlines()`\n",

    "# Open the file in read mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "# Read all lines into a list\n",

    "print(lines)\n",
    "# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples:\n",
    "- Replace `'example.txt'` with the path to your file.\n",
    "- `file.close()` is used to close the file after reading to free up resources."
