    "# Tuples in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Tuple?\n",
    "A tuple is a collection of items that are ordered and immutable. Immutable means that once a tuple is created, you cannot change its elements. Tuples are used to group together related data, and they are defined using parentheses `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of Tuples:\n",
    "1. **Ordered**: Tuples maintain the order of elements as they are added.\n",
    "2. **Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified.\n",
    "3. **Allows Duplicates**: Tuples can contain duplicate elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a Tuple:\n",
    "You can create a tuple by placing a sequence of values separated by commas within parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# An empty tuple\n",
    "empty_tuple = ()\n",
    "\n",
    "# A tuple with one item\n",
    "single_item_tuple = (5,)\n",
    "\n",
    "# A tuple with multiple items\n",
    "multiple_items_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Tuple Elements:\n",
    "You can access elements in a tuple by using indexing. Indexing starts at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the first item\n",
    "print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the second item\n",
    "print(fruits[1])  # Output: banana\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the last item\n",
    "print(fruits[2])  # Output: cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuple Slicing:\n",
    "You can access a range of items in a tuple by using slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Slicing from index 1 to 3 (3 is not included)\n",
    "print(numbers[1:3])  # Output: (1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Slicing from the beginning to index 3 (3 is not included)\n",
    "print(numbers[:3])  # Output: (0, 1, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Slicing from index 2 to the end\n",
    "print(numbers[2:])  # Output: (2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuples are Immutable:\n",
    "You cannot change the items in a tuple once it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to change the second item\n",
    "# This will raise an error\n",
    "my_tuple[1] = 4  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuple Methods:\n",
    "Tuples have two built-in methods: `count()` and `index()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **count()**: Returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers = (1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4)\n",
    "   print(numbers.count(1))  # Output: 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **index()**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   letters = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b')\n",
    "   print(letters.index('b'))  # Output: 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Packing and Unpacking Tuples:\n",
    "**Packing**: Assigning multiple values to a single tuple.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = 1, 2, 3  # Packing values into a tuple\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unpacking**: Assigning tuple values to multiple variables.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, b, c = my_tuple  # Unpacking the tuple into variables\n",
    "print(a)  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(b)  # Output: 2\n",
    "print(c)  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Tuples:\n",
    "- When you want to ensure that the data cannot be changed.\n",
    "- When you need to store a collection of items that should remain in a specific order.\n",
    "- When you want to use the tuple as a key in a dictionary (since tuples are hashable and lists are not).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items.\n",
    "- Defined using parentheses `()`.\n",
    "- Elements can be accessed using indexing and slicing.\n",
    "- Tuples support two methods: `count()` and `index()`.\n",
    "- Tuples can be packed and unpacked for easy assignment of multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are a simple yet powerful data structure in Python that are perfect for storing and accessing related data in a fixed order."

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **all()**: Returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are true (or if the tuple is empty).\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   print(all(my_tuple))  # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_tuple = (0, 1, 2)\n",
    "   print(all(my_tuple))  # Output: False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **any**: Returns `True` if any element in the tuple is true. If the tuple is empty, it returns `False`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (0, 1, 2)\n",
    "   print(any(my_tuple))  # Output: True\n",
